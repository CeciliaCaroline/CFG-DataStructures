 * This is the longest path from the root to any leaf node.
 * If the tree has multiple levels, the height is the number of edges from the root to the farthest leaf.

TASK:
To find the sum of all *leaf* nodes:

We recursively traverse through the tree.
Check if a node is a leaf node or not.

APPROACH:
- If a node is a leaf node then add its data to total.
